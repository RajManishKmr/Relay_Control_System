# Project Title
## Hardware Implementation of Relay Control with Enhanced Autotune Identification Using Machine Learning

# Abstract
Relay-based parameter identification of dynamical systems ensures robust and effective
control strategies in automatic control systems. It ensures stable, sustained oscillatory
output, which is vital for the parameter identification of unknown process models. Describing function-based sets of expressions are derived to identify the parameters of the
first order plus dead time (FOPDT) transfer function model for single and multiple poles.
A hardware model is constructed with a transportation delay of at least one second and
consists of a relay circuit, a process model, and a delay circuit. Machine learning models
are integrated to enhance the accuracy of parameter identification. Real-time data from the
hardware model, obtained by modifying the physical components of the process model, is
utilized to train the machine learning model for improved autotune identification.
